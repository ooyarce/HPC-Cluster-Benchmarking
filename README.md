# Cluster-CPU-Amd-Ryzen-9-5950x-Benchmarking
A list of codes to see the matrix linear operations in High Perfomance Computing using PETSc framework.

The main objective of this script is to benchmark the cluster, which consist in a x12 AMD R95950x 64Gb Ram system, in the linear matrix operations, to find the optimal configuration to the simulations models in the program STKO, which uses MUMPs Solver.

In first place, I use PETSc Library to see the behavior of Sparse and Dense matrix ensambling, Ax=b solving and both. Then, I make another benchmark script to see the calculus time of the real simulations models with MUMPs.
